                 Lung cancer is the second most common cancer, accounting for about one out of five malignancies in men and one out of nine in women. Unfortunately, over the past several years, while the incidence of lung cancer has gradually declined in men, it has been rising alarmingly in women. In 1940 only seven women in 100,000 developed the disease; today the rate is 42 in 100,000. And all the evidence points to smoking as the cause.

                    <li>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women.</li>
                    <li>Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for approximately 85% of all cases.</li>
                    <li> Lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options are limited.</li>

                    <li>Primary prevention (such as tobacco control measures and reducing exposure to environmental risk factors) can reduce the incidence of lung cancer and save lives.</li>

                        Lung cancer typically doesn't cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of lung cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced.
 
                        Signs and symptoms of lung cancer that happen in and around the lungs may include:

                        The test results will help them recommend a treatment plan for you. The first test is usually an x-ray, which is often followed by a CT scan. You may also have a breathing test to check how your lungs are working and blood tests to check your overall health.

                        The stages of lung cancer range from 0 to 4 based on how advanced the cancer is. Lower numbers are less advanced and have a higher survival rate. Higher stages are more advanced and have a lower survival rate.

                        There are different lung cancer classification systems based on the type of cancer. Information used in staging lung cancer includes the size of the main tumor, cancer in the lymph nodes, and the spread of cancer to other areas of the body. 
                        
                        The lung cancer staging system lets oncologists (cancer specialists) effectively communicate with and about the patient, make accurate treatment decisions, and determine the course of the disease.
